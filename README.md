# About xo #

xo is a cli tool to generate [Golang](https://golang.org/project/) types and
funcs based on a database schema or a custom query. xo is designed to vastly
reduce the overhead/redundancy of writing (from scratch) Go types and funcs for
common database tasks.

Currently, xo can generate types for tables, enums, stored procedures, and
custom SQL queries for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite databases.

Additionally, support for other database abstractions (ie, views, many-to-many
relationships, etc) are in varying states of completion, and will be added as
soon as they are in a usable state.

Please note that xo is **NOT** an ORM, nor does xo generate an ORM. Instead, xo
generates Go code by using database metadata to query the types and
relationships within the database, and then generates representative Go types
and funcs for well-defined database relationships using raw queries.

mkdir models

# generate code for a postgres schema
xo pgsql://user:pass@host/dbname -o models

# generate code for a custom postgres query
xo pgsql://user:pass@host/dbname -N -M -B -T AuthorResult -o models/ << ENDSQL
SELECT
  a.name::varchar AS name,
  b.type::integer AS my_type
FROM authors a
  INNER JOIN authortypes b ON a.id = b.author_id
WHERE
  a.id = %%authorID int%%
LIMIT %%limit int%%
ENDSQL

# build generated code
go build ./models

# End-to-End Example #

For example, given the following PostgreSQL schema:
```PLpgSQL
CREATE TABLE authors (
  author_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  isbn text NOT NULL DEFAULT '' UNIQUE,
  name text NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
  subject text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''
);

CREATE INDEX authors_name_idx ON authors(name);

CREATE TYPE book_type AS ENUM (
  'FICTION',
  'NONFICTION'
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id integer NOT NULL REFERENCES authors(author_id),
    title text NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    booktype book_type NOT NULL DEFAULT 'FICTION',
    year integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 2000
);

CREATE INDEX books_title_idx ON books(title, year);

CREATE FUNCTION say_hello(text) RETURNS text AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN CONCAT('hello ' || $1);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Oracle Support ##

Oracle support is disabled by default as the Go driver for it relies on the
Oracle client libs that may not be installed on your system. If you would like
to build a version of xo with Oracle support, please first [install rana's
Oracle driver](https://github.com/rana/ora#installation).

On Ubuntu/Debian, you may download the instantclient RPMs [available from
here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html).
You should then be able to do the following:

```sh
# install alien, if not already installed
sudo aptitude install alien

# install the instantclient RPMs
alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-basic-*.rpm
alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-devel-*.rpm
alien -i oracle-instantclient-12.1-sqlplus-*.rpm

# get xo, if not done already
go get -u github.com/knq/xo

# copy oci8.pc from xo contrib to pkg-config directory
sudo cp $GOPATH/src/github.com/knq/xo/contrib/oci8.pc /usr/lib/pkgconfig/

# export cgo flags (rana's ora driver does not have a cgo pkg-config tag [yet])
export CGO_CFLAGS=$(pkg-config --cflags oci8)
export CGO_LDFLAGS=$(pkg-config --libs oci8)

# install rana's ora driver -- see here: https://github.com/rana/ora
go get -u gopkg.in/rana/ora.v3

# install xo with oracle support enabled
go install -tags oracle github.com/knq/xo
```

# Design, Origin, Philosophy, and History #

xo can likely get you 99% "of the way there" on medium or large database
schemas and 100% of the way there for small or trivial database schemas. In
short, xo is a great launching point for developing standardized packages for
standard database abstractions/relationships, and xo's most common use-case is
indeed in a code generation pipeline, ala ```stringer```.

**NOTE:** While the code generated by xo is production quality, it is not the
goal, nor the intention for xo to be a "silver bullet," nor to completely
eliminate the manual authoring of SQL / Go code.

xo was originally developed while migrating a "large" application written in
PHP to Go. The schema in use in the original app, while well designed, had
become inconsistent over multiple iterations/generations, mainly due to
different naming styles adopted by various developers/database admins over the
preceding years. Additionally, some components had been written in different
languages (Ruby, Java) and had also accumulated significant drift from the
original application and schema. Simultaneously, a large amount of growth meant
that the PHP/Ruby code could no longer efficiently serve the traffic volumes.

In late 2014/early 2015, a decision was made to unify and strip out certain
backend services and to fully isolate the API from the original application,
allowing the various components to instead speak to a common API layer instead
of directly to the database, and to build that service layer in Go.

However, unraveling the old PHP/Ruby/Java code became a relatively large
headache as the code, the database, and the API, had all experienced
significant drift, and thus underlying function names, fields, and API methods
no longer aligned. As such, after a round of standardizing names, dropping
accumulated cruft, and adding a small number of relationship changes to the
schema, the various codebases were fixed to match the schema changes. After
that was determined to be a success, the next target was to rewrite the backend
services in Go.

In order to keep a similar and consistent workflow for the developers, the
previous code generator (written in PHP and Twig templates) was modified to
generate Go code. Additionally, at this time, but tangential to the story here,
the API definitions were ported from JSON to Protobuf to make use of its code
generation abilities as well.

xo is the open source version of that code generation tool, and is the the
fruits of those development efforts. It is hoped that others will be able to
use and expand xo to support other databases, SQL or otherwise, and that xo can
become a common tool in any Go developer's toolbox.

Part of xo's goal is to avoid writing an ORM, or an ORM-like in Go, and to
instead generate static, type-safe, fast, and idiomatic Go code. Additionally,
the xo developers are of the opinion that relational databases should have
proper, well-designed relationships and all the related definitions should
reside within the database schema itself -- call it "self-documenting" schema.
xo is an end to that pursuit.
